          <h1 id="clariphy-code-of-conduct">CLARIPHY Code Of Conduct</h1>
<p>CLARIPHY is a collaboration of academic and national laboratory researchers
interested in AI research, particle physics research and the synergies
between the two fields..</p>

<p>Naturally, this implies diversity of ideas and perspectives on often complex
problems. Disagreement and healthy discussion of conflicting viewpoints is
welcome: the best solutions to hard problems rarely come from a single angle.
But disagreement is not an excuse for aggression: humans tend to take
disagreement personally and easily drift into behavior that ultimately degrades
a community. This is particularly acute with online communication across
language and cultural gaps, where many cues of human behavior are unavailable.
We are outlining here a set of principles and processes to support a healthy
community in the face of these challenges. Fundamentally, we are committed to
fostering an open, productive, harassment-free environment for everyone. Rather
than considering this code an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do, take
it in the spirit it is intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us
and the communities in which we participate. Importantly: as a member of our
community, you are also a steward of these values. Not all problems need to be
resolved via formal processes, and often a quick, friendly but clear word on an
online forum or in person can help resolve a misunderstanding and de-escalate
things. However, sometimes these informal processes may be inadequate: they fail
to work, there is urgency or risk to someone, nobody is intervening publicly and
you don’t feel comfortable speaking in public, etc. For these or other reasons,
structured follow-up may be necessary and here we provide the means for that: we
welcome reports by contacting [COMING SOON]. This code of conduct applies equally to all
community members in all Institute situations online and offline, including
conferences, training events, mailing lists, forums, GitHub organizations, chat rooms, social
media, social events associated with conferences and events, and one-to-one interactions.</p>

<p>By embracing the following principles, guidelines and actions to follow or
avoid, you will help us make CLARIPHY a welcoming and productive community.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be friendly and patient</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be welcoming</strong>. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people
of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to,
members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration
status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family status,
technological choices, academic discipline, political views, religion, mental
ability, and physical ability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be considerate</strong>. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will
depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community. You may be communicating
with someone with a different primary language or cultural background.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be respectful</strong>. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Respect the work of others.
We recognize the acknowledgment/citation requests of the original authors. As
authors, we are explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
acknowledged.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose</strong>. Be kind to others. Do not
insult or put down other community members. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>Violent threats or violent language directed against another person</li>
      <li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
      <li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
      <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</li>
      <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
      <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
      <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why</strong>. Disagreements, both social
and technical, happen all the time and the CLARIPHY community is no exception.
Try to understand where others are coming from, as seeing a question from their
viewpoint may help find a new path forward. And don’t forget that it is human to
err: blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, while we can learn from
mistakes to find better solutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>A simple apology can go a long way</strong>. It can
often de-escalate a situation, and telling someone that you are sorry is an act
of empathy that doesn’t automatically imply an admission of guilt.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in a
timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community for
everyone and we take them seriously.</p>

<p>You can file a report by emailing [COMING SOON].</p>
